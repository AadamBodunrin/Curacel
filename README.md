# Curacel Mini Coding Test

This repo is a response to a coding test by Curacel, an Health Tech company in Lagos, Nigeria. 

With regards to the test, I have attached my response [Curacel_Mini_Test.py](https://github.com/AadamBodunrin/Curacel/blob/master/Curacel_Mini_Test.py). My solution is cloud-based; I used IBM Watson studio to build the model and created a REST API using IBM Watson services.

The python file demos the ways to access the desired result and I added several comment for understanding.
